#!/bin/bash
# rev-mutate.sh <session-dir> <test-command>
#   Reverts each changed hunk on its own, keeping every other change in the tree, and runs the
#   test command. A hunk whose revert leaves the command passing is unpinned: no test proves
#   that line. Exits 0 every hunk pinned, 2 the session is not in a phase known to be panel-free,
#   3 an unpinned hunk, 4 the run measured nothing (a command that does not pass on the unmutated
#   tree, a hunk that would not apply, a revert that changed no byte, a changed file that is a
#   symlink or has no text hunk, or no changed hunk at all).
#
#   4 outranks 3: a run that could not revert one hunk has not earned a verdict about the rest.
#   A measurement that did not happen is the failure this tool exists to prevent, because it
#   reads exactly like a real one: every revert is proved by hash, and the command is proved to
#   pass on the unmutated tree, before any verdict counts.
#
#   It refuses while a panel is live because seats read the live tree, and a script that reverts
#   hunks for seconds at a time shows them a tree that is neither base nor fix.
#
#   Scope: unstaged changes to tracked, non-symlink files under REV_ROOT. Staged and untracked
#   files are named on stderr and not measured. Each hunk is measured against the COMPLETE fix:
#   the file is restored from a backup this run took, never from the commit.
